# Hangman-Game
My first project was a Hangman game on GitHub

Hangman is a guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters.

To start, the player is given a word in which all letters are replaced with underscores (_), so the only information available is the number of letters in the answer.

In each round, the player guesses a letter. If the letter guessed is in the answer, its position (or positions) in the word is revealed. Once the player successfully fills in the hidden word with its correct letters, the player wins!

The player accumulates mistakes if the letter guessed is not in the answer. If they make it to six (6) mistakes without finding the answer, the player loses!
The name of the game comes from a drawing of a hanged stick figure. After each mistake, a new element of the hanged figure is drawn.

If the player doesn't guess the word before the last element of the figure is drawn, the player is hanged!
