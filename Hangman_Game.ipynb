        "5. Inside the for loop, after the incomplete if statement, increment the `index_count` by 2 each time it loops.

Now we want to *update* `hidden_word` so that, when the letter guessed is in the `answer_word`, we replace the corresponding underscores in hidden word with the correctly guessed letter (_ _ _ _ -> _ _ E _). Inside the for loop's if statement, whenever we find letters that match, use the `index_count` to slice and then concatonate the `hidden_word` such that it now consist of: the first part of the `hidden_word` + the correctly `picked_letter` + the remaining characters of the `hidden_word` (except the underscore that is being replaced). This should replace an underscore in `hidden_word` with the correct letter wherever the `picked_letter` matches up with a character in `answer_word`. <br><br>\n",
        "7. Add another condition to the while loop that will check if the number of underscores `_` inside the `hidden_word` is different than 0. This will allow us to end the loop when the players wins (right now it only ends when they lose).<br><br>\n",

        "- Add code that checks users' inputs to make sure they are allowed (i.e. no digits or special characters allowed, no more than one letter allowed, etc.) and returns an error message (without counting the input as a mistake) if the input does not comply.\n",
